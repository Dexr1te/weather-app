# Weather App 🌤️  
*(add your badges here — build status, license, version, etc.)*

A clean and modern weather forecast application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **React Query**, and **Zustand**.  
The app fetches real-time weather data and a 5-day forecast, visualizes it, and provides a smooth, responsive UI.
